# RL2.ModLoader.DevSetup
A simple cross platform program to ease starting the development process of RL2.ModLoader for new contributros.
Upon running the program:
- The user is prompted to point to the installation directory of Rogue Legacy 2.
  - It's the one with the games executable.
- The necessary library files are copied to a `../lib/` directory.

### Use of this program is not necessary, it's just a utility. 
If one wishes to perform a manual setup:
- Open the games installation directory.
- Open the `Rogue Legacy 2_Data/Managed` directory.
- Copy all files except of `RL2.ModLoader.dll` if present.
