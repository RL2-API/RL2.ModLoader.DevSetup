# RL2.ModLoader.DevSetup
A simple cross platform program to ease starting the development process of RL2.ModLoader for new contributros.
Upon running the program:
- The user is prompted to point to the Rogue Legacy 2 executable.

    - It contains shared references to all libraries used by Rogue Legacy 2.
